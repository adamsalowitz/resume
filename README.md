 I consider myself a system admin with strong automation and developer skills.  I'm comfortable in most OS and network environments and able to master new skills, languages, technologies quickly.  I'm great at documentation and enjoy mentoring and teaching.  Being at the vanguard of a DevOps transformation in a large enterprise has prepared me for the challenges ahead as the industry accelerates.  By iterating in small, shippable increments & documenting as I go, I'm able to bridge the gaps between developers and operations teams to enable rapid and successful releases.
