 I consider myself a system admin with strong automation and developer skills.  I'm comfortable in most OS and network environments and able to  master new skills, languages, technologies quickly.  I'm great at documentation and enjoy mentoring and teaching.  Being at the vanguard of a DevOps transformation in a large enterprise has prepared me for the challenges ahead as the industry accelerates.  I've learned to work in small shippable increments, document as I go, fail fast, and to be agile.
